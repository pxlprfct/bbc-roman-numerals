# Technical Challenge

**BBC Coding Kata - Roman Numerals**

The purpose of this exercise is not simply to solve the problem; instead, we are interested in how you approach the problem.
Please complete the coding exercise and then submit the code listing to your email contact at the BBC.  Please explain your approach, assumptions made, or caveats to your solution and add these to the email.

We are particularly interested in the following:
- Code quality
- Code readability
- Testing

The problem
In whatever language you prefer, write a class that implements the following interface (example given in Java):
```
public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {
   public String generate(int number); 
}
```

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs: 
```
1 = “I” 
5 = “V” 
10 = “X” 
20 = “XX” 
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”
```

Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999
